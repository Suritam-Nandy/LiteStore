                        In the previous <a href="blog-future-of-retail-1.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>, we wrote about how physical retail spaces as we understand today might undergo what experts term as a ‘brick &amp; mortar renaissance’. The focus will not be about the stores as much as the stories that these stores narrate. Stories that are presented through the design of the store and the themes they display. The earlier post looked at breaking away from the notion that stores are the focal point of driving sales, in this post we will look at another trend that’s been explored by brands across Tokyo, Barcelona and New York.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Have you ever wondered why some of the Michelin Star restaurants serve very <a href="https://www.blueskydreamers.com/why-do-fancy-restaurants-serve-small-portions/" target="_blank">small portions</a> of food? Apart from the fact that it makes for Instagram-worthy pictures, consumer psychology offers a clinical understanding to it. The taste buds are most excited by the first few bites of eating the dish which makes the experience more meaningful &amp; relevant. On a similar note, stores which have a minimal or a modular themed focus enhances the sensory experiences of customers compared to stores which are packed to the rafters leaving little or no space for customers to interact with the products. 
                        </p>
                        <p style={{paddingTop: '10px'}}>
                        A classic example of this is a <a href="https://medium.com/culturistique/morioka-shoten-a-single-room-with-a-single-book-a224595f7045" target="_blank">bookstore in Ginza, Tokyo</a> bookstore in Ginza, Tokyo. Each week a book is chosen and sold with no other books displayed. There is no browsing here. Only a rich, deep and intentional focus with a singular intimate experience with the product i.e a book. The modular store is designed with the theme of the book displayed that week. The value addition of the store is that the authors receive an invitation from the publisher. When an author enters the bookstore, open dialogues and conversations emerge between the visitors and the author. Imagine walking into a store on a given day and you found Ruskin Bond or Vikram Seth having a light moment with their readers! The buzz that would create and persuade people to visit such stores and create a lasting public memory, far surpasses the need to hoard books and fill in space with just books.

                        Admittedly, from a sales point of view, it makes more financial sense to pack the store with inventory. But that would be missing the point. Creating a lasting impression of your brand in a customer’s mind is not merely about making a sale then and there. It is about creating an experience which builds a positive association with the brand. Doing this offline, in a physical store, is not only unique but creates a deeper, more personal bond with the customer.

                        It runs against common sense when one hears that physical retail spaces are located far away from the shopping districts of the town. Logic dictates that due to agglomeration economics in cities, shopping districts directly benefit from the high footfall in premier clustered spaces. Thereby, driving up the value of the real estate in that vicinity. A prominent factor which gives rise to these shopping districts is the accessibility to these places, usually situated at prominent places in the city. The logical extension of that thought is that, the more accessible the place – the higher footfall that it would witness, thereby, increasing sales. However, recent trends in consumer psychology points to an entirely different story. With the advent of mass consumerism an entire generation thrived on owning products – be it an expensive watch or a car. However, evidence now points to the idea that experience has become the new social currency, marking a significant shift from just the possession of the products. Questions such as – where you are, who you are with, what you’re doing forms the basis for a lot many initiatives today. It therefore, comes as no surprise that the eatery which churns out <a href="https://www.restaurantindia.in/article/We-serve-8-000-10-000-customers-daily-Amrik-Singh.6887" target="_blank">8000-10000 parathas</a> on an ordinary day is not one that is based out a prominent shopping district in Delhi but in a sleepy village called <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/features/magazine/food-safari-in-search-of-murthal-ke-paranthe/article4364734.ece" target="_blank">Murthal</a> that is situated 50 kms away from it. The reason why the eateries dotted on that highway sell that many parathas has very little to do with the parathas themselves but a lot to do with the drive to the place, the music accompanying the drive and all the fun in between with our friends.

                        Brands which explore spaces in this manner effectively create destinations for their customers. A relevant example in this context, is the Prada store located in a town in Texas <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine,_Texas" target="_blank">whose entire population in the year 2010 was 134</a>. It should surprise the minds of anyone that one of the most iconic brands in the fashion history with a continuing legacy for more than 100 years would set up a physical store in a nearly non-existent town rather than penetrating the high streets in Selfridges or SoHo with much more vigour.

                        The devil of course, lies in the details. The Prada store on this dusty plot of land is not an actual store but a fake one! Prada’s merchandise is locked inside that store and people can just view it from the outside. It was opened in the year 2005, in the middle of a Texas desert. The goal was to leave this <a href="https://www.insider.com/prada-marfa-texas-desert-tour-2020-8" target="_blank">fake store completely untouched</a>, so it would slowly decompose into nature and thereby, serving as a subtle nod to American consumerism and retail tourism. Like we stated earlier, less of a store and more of a story. This store gave Americans one of the greatest <a href="https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-fake-prada-store-texas-desert-art-mecca" target="_blank">selfie destinations</a> till date. Apart from appearing on The Simpsons and in Beyoncé’s Instagram feed, it has attracted countless other social media influencers and it still remains as an iconic destination for tourists and even celebrities.
