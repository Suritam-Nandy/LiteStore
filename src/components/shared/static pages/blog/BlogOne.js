                <p className="post-intro" style={{ paddingTop: "10px" }}>
                  Why would anyone enter a retail store in 2021? The digital
                  revolution and the subsequent rise of e-commerce giants has
                  ensured that customers can now shop from the comfort of their
                  homes. The disruption in the digital space has had tectonic
                  effects on how brands view retail strategy, customer
                  acquisition &amp; digital marketing. The economic catastrophe
                  caused by the 2008 recession and the recent Covid-19 Pandemic
                  has led to severe liquidity crunch adversely affecting the
                  sustainability of several retailers.
                </p>
                <p style={{ paddingTop: "10px" }}>
                  Long term leases, very high monthly rents and security
                  deposits during such economic downturn might lead us to
                  believe that we might be witnessing a ‘Retail Apocalypse’. It
                  just requires one to take a casual stroll through any of the
                  prominent shopping districts in the metropolitan cities in
                  India, to understand that the severity of the situation is not
                  an exaggeration. The number of vacant retail spaces far
                  surpasses the number of retail spaces occupied by retailers,
                  with the gap between the two only increasing day after day.

                <p style={{ paddingTop: "10px" }}>
                  This isn’t to suggest that the Landowners aren’t bleeding as
                  well. Nor does it suggest that we won’t see as many retail
                  spaces after the pandemic. However, one thing’s for sure – the
                  future of physical retail spaces isn’t going to be the same
                  anymore and it is necessary that the retail and the real
                  estate industry accounts for these disruptive changes in their
                  business strategies.

                  What are these disruptive changes? In this blog, we will
                  attempt to cull out a few trends that the physical retail

                  covering the trends in the retail industry, an interesting
                  idea was put forward. One of the speakers quipped ‘Retail is
                  the New Media and Online is the New Store’. It effectively
                  conveys the idea that over the last few decades, there has
                  been a complete role reversal between the medium of marketing
                  and the medium of sales. With digital shopping being
                  ubiquitous and a large chunk of sales taking place online,
                  stores have to transition into the new medium for brands to
                  market their product.
                </p>
                <p style={{ paddingTop: "10px" }}>
                  It is difficult to believe that many Fortune 500 brands today
                  have opened multiple stores in different cities with no sales
                  taking place in any of these stores. Yet this seems to be the
                  new trend. What is it then that drives them to open these
                  stores? The closest parallel that can be drawn to understand
                  this, is to understand the economics going behind erecting
                  billboard ads or even creating sensational advertisements on
                  social media. No one is thinking in real terms of how much the
                  brand earned directly in sales when the{" "}

                  makes a witty remark on a billboard ad or when Rahul Dravid

                    Cred ad
                  </a>
                  . The idea of the ads far surpasses the metric of sales and
                  ventures into more qualitative economic metrics which is: to
                  inform, persuade and remind customers of the brand and its
                  product along with creating a strong recall value.

                  The key to the future of retail also lies in adopting a
                  strategy which focuses on experience, reach and innovation.
                  Let us consider a stark example of this trend in the{" "}

                  in 2017. They ran a contest in which participants had to
                  submit the wackiest Cheetos shapes they found in their bag of
                  chips. The top prize winner took home a whopping $ 50,000. To
                  display more than 100,000 entries, they opened a pop-up store
                  in New York. Remember, no sales took place in the store.

                  Let us look at another brand adopting a similar strategy but
                  this time the store is situated in the busy street of Harajuku
                  in Tokyo. Dohtonbori is a famous organic health food chain in
                  Japan and in the year 2016, they opened up a temporary
                  storefront at Harajuku which was{" "}

                  The pop-up store had a neon red cross glowed behind the
                  counter while two women in white lab coats showed customers
                  scientific-charts and the pop-up had jars of pills stored
                  everywhere. Look at the image below and you’d understand why
                  it could easily pass off as a store conducting scientific
                  experiments. However, a walk into the store revealed an
                  entirely different concept. A closer look at the panel
                  explained the concept succinctly:
